# Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

This project aims to analyze a dataset from the Google Merchandise Store (GStore) and predict the revenue per customer using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about customer interactions with the online store, such as visit details, device information, geographical data, and transaction revenue.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the revenue generated by customers on the Google Merchandise Store. By understanding customer behavior and predicting revenue, businesses can gain valuable insights for marketing strategies, personalized targeting, and revenue optimization.

## Code Overview

The project code follows the following steps:

- **Importing the required libraries:** This includes libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, json, and lightgbm for data processing, visualization, and modeling.
- **Data loading and preprocessing:** The load_df function is defined to read and preprocess the CSV data. It normalizes JSON columns, merges them with the main DataFrame, and concatenates chunks of data. The train and test datasets are loaded using this function and memory optimization techniques are applied to reduce memory usage.
- **Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA):** Missing values are filled, data types are converted, and descriptive statistics are calculated. EDA steps include plotting category rate bar charts, extracting date features, analyzing device and geoNetwork data, and handling trafficSource data.
- **Feature engineering:** Additional features are created by aggregating data and extracting meaningful information.
- **Model training and evaluation:** The dataset is split into train and test datasets based on the presence of transaction revenue. A LGBMRegressor model is trained using GroupKFold cross-validation. Feature importance is calculated and the model is evaluated.
- **Prediction and submission:** Predictions are made for the test dataset using the trained model. The results are stored in a submission DataFrame, transformed, and aggregated by fullVisitorId. The submission is saved as a CSV file.

## Results and Conclusion

The trained model provides predictions for the test dataset, estimating the revenue per customer on the Google Merchandise Store. The feature importance analysis helps to identify the most influential factors in predicting revenue. The submission file contains the aggregated predicted revenue for each customer.

By analyzing customer behavior and predicting revenue, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer preferences, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance revenue generation on their online platforms.
